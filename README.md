Beta. Script accepts multiple images, plots them on a grid, generates against them, then splits them up again. Increase consistency between images when generated in same latent space.

- Adjust rows and columns until image is most square and within size limits you can handle.
- Set max dimensions to constrain generated sheet within your known limits.
- Press "generate sheet." Image will populate.
- Press "generate" in img2img. Images will be sent to default directory.
